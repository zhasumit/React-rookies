The syntax of object creation from the tags input is done by bundlers 
bundlers are like vite and babel and other things that have predefined syntax 
syntax conversion is also done by bundlers 

like we did this in the previous customisation
const reactElement = {
	type: "a",
	props: {
		href: "https://google.com/",
		target: "_blank",
	},
	children: "Click me to visit Google",
};

jsx : js mixed with html, which is parsed into a tree like object above
