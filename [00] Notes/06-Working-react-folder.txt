Mostly all the work is done in the src (source) folder 

in src directory : 
    app.js
    indes.js
    are Very important -> taken as root in the public folder of the project which is main 


in vite folder 
    main.jsx 
    app.jsx 
    are the main project files 


In libraries, naming conventions are not very important 
In framework, naming conventions are very strict and taken very seriously
