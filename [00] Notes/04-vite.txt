vite is a bundler 
    MAKING the project:
        npm create vite@latest 
        select react 
        select js 

    RUNNING the project : 
        cd projectName
        npm install 
        npm run dev 

its very fast 
    - package.json again contains all the information about the project
    - contains no node modules folder (since its is bulky (download only what u need))
    - dependencies only contains react and react-dom no testing dependencies
    - there are a lot of dev-dependencies (they donot go into production), only used in prodcution
