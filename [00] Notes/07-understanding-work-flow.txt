all the node modules files are installed on the basis of package.json file 
node modules are easily downloaded when npm install is done

.gitignore : 
    contains the list of files to be ignored to be pushed onto git 
    like node modules folder /build folder .env files, etc

package-lock.json : 
    same as package.json but the dependencies are locked and only run on that versions 




all the important stuff is done in the source folder or the public folder
/puiblic/manifest   ->  in mobile devices the files and folder are taken in meta tags via this manifest 
/puiblic/robots.txt -> its for the search engines 
/puiblic/index.html -> the main page that is rendered on the project 
    This single file contains the root which handles all the components inside the react 
    this is the reason it's also called SPA - single page application 


/puiblic/index.html : 
    <noscript> if the js is not enabled : gives message to enable the js
    single div with id root



/src/index.js : 
    react -> core react library for taking refernces
    react-DOM -> implement the react on to the web

    const root = react-DOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
    take element in index.html of id root and store it in root variable

    root.render() : renders the jsx 
    jsx are the custom tags 
    
    <ReactStrictMode> : 
            property of react, specific for developement 
            used for certain optimizations 


/src/app.js :
    function that returns some html using jsx syntax
    at last the function is exported


SUMMARY: 
Function --> reanders HTML and return it --> export it --> exported things is imported and used as jsx
write js using html
