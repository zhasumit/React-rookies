Here only react and react-dom is used 
index.html is outside the public 
so it is html is direcly loading the js files 


in the npx style const root was taking the reference and then rendering the things 
here direcly react-DOM.render is done after taking the reference using getElementById


NOTHING much of a difference 
vite bundler is simply lightweight,     
since scripts and testing libraries are not present inthis 


rendering a function with html exporting it to a diff jsx file and then rendering again is the main logic 

- rendering the component, name must be uppercase

- also the vite only takes components in the jsx format   
- some libraries take the things and only allow jsx
        - but react using npx takes js and jsx not a problem



all the elements are enclosed in a common single jsx 
a single <></> fragment tag is taken to enclose all the divs and single tags 



Function exporting is called components in  react



React and react-DOM makes the method
parallel DOM is maintained by a react-DOM and stored in root 
only root element is tinkered and taken into hands for manupulation
