the values will not be changing multiple times 
since in useState things happens in batches
once a batch a change is executed

fiber diff algo takes diffing and updates on a batch in the virtualDOM tree

using the callback function inside the useState 
then we call the previousState and 
thence all the values are changed multiple times


here prevCounter is counter only but reference to the last value 
setCounter((prevCounter) => prevCounter + 1)

using this method the values are not called in batches and so one after another the changes take place
