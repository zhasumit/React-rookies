React Fiber Architecture
Introduction
React Fiber is reimplementation of React's core algorithm. 

The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures. 
Its headline feature is incremental rendering: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.

key features include 
the ability to pause, abort, or reuse work as new updates come in
the ability to assign priority to different types of updates; and new concurrency primitives.
does the hydration process (injection of js into the html)

---

Virtual dom -> creates a tree which is parallel to the actual tree structure of html
ONLY the changed parts are used (also a queue is maintained on the basis of priority)

Prerequisites
React Components, Elements, and Instances - 
    "Component" is often an overloaded term. A firm grasp of these terms is crucial.

Reconciliation - 
    A high-level description of React's reconciliation algorithm.

React Basic Theoretical Concepts - 
    A description of the conceptual model of React without implementation burden. Some of this may not make sense on first reading. That's okay, it will make more sense with time.

React Design Principles - 
    Pay special attention to the section on scheduling. It does a great job of explaining the why of React Fiber.

What is reconciliation?

reconciliation
    The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed. update 
A change in the data used to render a React app. Usually the result of `setState`. Eventually results in are-render.

The central idea of React's API is to think of updates as if they cause the entire app to re-render. This allows the developer to reason declaratively, rather than worry about how to efficiently transition the app from any particular state to another (A to B, B to C, C to A, and so on).

Actually re-rendering the entire app on each change only works for the most trivial apps; in a real-world app, it's prohibitively costly in terms of performance. React has optimizations which create the appearance of whole app re-rendering while maintaining great performance. The bulk of these optimizations are part of a process called reconciliation.

Reconciliation is the algorithm behind what is popularly understood as the "virtual DOM." 

A high-level description goes something like this: when you render a React application, a tree of nodes that describes the app is generated and saved in memory. 
This tree is then flushed to the rendering environment — for example, in the case of a browser application, it's translated to a set of DOM operations. When the app is updated (usually via setState), a new tree is generated. The new tree is diffed with the previous tree to compute which operations are needed to update the rendered app.

The key points are:

Different component types are assumed to generate substantially different trees. React will not attempt to diff them, but rather replace the old tree completely.
Diffing of lists is performed using keys. Keys should be "stable, predictable, and unique."

list performance increases

The key points are:

- In a UI, it's not necessary for every update to be applied immediately; in fact, doing so can be wasteful, causing frames to drop and degrading the user experience.
- Different types of updates have different priorities — an animation update needs to complete more quickly than, say, an update from a data store.
- A push-based approach requires the app (you, the programmer) to decide how to schedule work. A pull-based approach allows the framework (React) to be smart and make those decisions for you.

Specifically, we need to be able to

- pause work and come back to it later.
- assign priority to different types of work.
- reuse previously completed work.
- abort work if it's no longer needed.
